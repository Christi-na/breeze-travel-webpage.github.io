				With a big hotel bill racking up and the cost of food and drink to think about, sometimes it’s difficult to fully unwind 
				whilst on holiday. But opt for a gorgeous all-inclusive resort and you’ll find that relaxing becomes a whole lot simpler.

			<p class="blog__text">
				All over the world you’ll find a variety of luxurious hotels and resorts offering an all-inclusive getaway, including food,
				 drinks, entertainment and sometimes even activities to ensure that you leave all your worries behind. Fancy a care-free family holiday? 
				 You’ll find that quite a few all-inclusive resorts will include kid’s and teen’s clubs in the offer too – meaning you can safely leave the kids to have fun whilst you sip on complimentary cocktails.

				<h5 class="">Haven Riviera Cancun</h5>
				<p>
					Who could resist the home of fresh tacos, bright and colourful décor and sensational beaches? Mexico is a very popular choice for an all-inclusive getaway, especially vivacious Cancun with
					 its long line of luxury resorts. Going all-inclusive gives you the chance to dine on as much Mexican cuisine as you like, all the while giving you a gorgeous spot to relax after exploring the likes of Chichén Itzá.

				<h2 class="blog__subtitle">Dubai and the Emirates</h2>
				<h5 class="">JA Beach Hotel</h5>
				<p>
					Fusing traditional Arabian architecture with glitzy and glamorous resorts, Dubai and the Emirates’ all-inclusive hotels add even more indulgence to an already lavish destination. You won’t need to worry about a thing
					 as you sunbathe on private beaches, dine on decadent cuisine, and laze around in stunning pools. All-inclusive is quite a new construct here, but they’ve certainly gone to town with what they’re offering.
				</p>
                <p>
					If fun activities followed by decadent food and drink is your forte, you’ll quickly fall in love with everything JA Beach Hotel has to offer. The resort’s enviable location means that you’re not far from fantastic 
					sightseeing and shopping opportunities,

				<h2 class="blog__subtitle">Barbados</h2>
				<h5 class="">Sea Breeze</h5>
				<p>
					Catering to your needs and still offering that intimate and personalised touch, the all-inclusive hotels in Barbados are truly fantastic. Whether you’re exploring the rugged east coast, sunbathing on the sugary
					 sands of the west coast, or swimming in the calm seas in the south, no doubt you’ll find a lavish hotel that suits your style and budget.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sea Breeze is one of our favourite all-inclusive hotels on Barbados’ south coast. Spend your days relaxing by the three enticing pools, or take a dip in one of the indulgent Jacuzzis. There are four fabulous 
					restaurants and bars to tempt your taste buds, including succulent seafood plucked straight from the ocean at Aqua Terra.

				<h2 class="blog__subtitle">Corfu</h2>
				<h5 class="">Ikos Dassia</h5>
				<p>
					Who could resist Corfu’s charming Greek hospitality, colourful towns and fun vibes? We love the lush landscape, the sociable locals, and of course the sensational Greek food, usually enjoyed alongside sensational views of the ocean.
				</p>
                <p>
					Cool and contemporary, Ikos Dassia evokes a modern and stylish atmosphere, offering the most incredible views from main pool and restaurants. We love the accommodation – the minimalist interiors lead out onto large balconies with 
					uninterrupted vistas of the island or the ocean.  There’s plenty included in your stay, including a lovely spa, water sports, a nightclub and delicious restaurants.
